 <h1>Alison Garrett-Engele</h1>
 <h5>Senior at Macalester College</h5>
<div class="line-break"></div>

 <p> I am a Senior at Macalester College with a major in computer science and a concentration in cognitive science. I became interested in programming after participating in weekly Girls Who Code meetings held in my highschool's basement. Since then, I have participated in group projects such as making a mobile app for my hometown's historical society and modifying a NST as well as held a research position as a Clare Boothe Scholar and an internship for Honeywell. At Honeywell, I worked with the application engineering team to migrate and develop applications on our Niagara framework for building HVAC use cases. As a Clare Boothe Scholar, I performed research at Macalester creating an accessible version of Wonder Workshop’s Blockly application for low vision middle schoolers.</p>
<p> To this day, I still participate in Girls Who Code through Macalester’s College Loop, and since high school, I’ve joined Women in Stem. I enjoy being a part of these communities because they act as a consistent reminder that programming is supposed to be about challenging oneself and enjoying the process of trial and error.</p>
