 <h1>Alison Garrett-Engele</h1>
 <h5>Macalester College</h5>
<div class="line-breakheader"></div>

 <p> I am a Senior at Macalester College with a major in computer science and a concentration in cognitive science. I became interested in programming after participating in weekly Girls Who Code meetings held in my highschool's basement. Since then, I have held an internship at Honeywell, a research position at Macalester, and developed numerous academic and personal projects ranging from games to NST. I am interested in software design, especifally accessibilty design, and ai from a programming and psychological perspective.</p>
 <p> When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading, writing poetry, and being outdoors!</p>

       <h3>COMP 484-01: Intro to AI</h3>
       <h3>Project: Painting for the Lazy: Neural Style Transfer Exploration and Comparison </h3>
       <p>For this team project, three of my fellow students and I implemented and modified an NST script in a Google Colab notebook based off of previous work performed by Yuan (2018). We used the VGG-19 model and custom gradient descent functions to compare different optimizers and intermediate layers of the VGG-19 model. This entailed first preprocessing the input images through scaling, normalization, and resizing the arrays to be compatible with the batch processing utilized by Eager Execution. Then, we could quantitatively and qualitatively analyze which optimizers and layers performed best. </p>

       <h3>Honeywell Application Engineer Intern</h3>
       <p>At Honeywell, I worked with the application engineering team to migrate and develop applications on our Niagara framework for building HVAC use cases. I created the back-end code necessary for migrating the balancing process for the Spyder 5 controller to HTML 5. Specifically, I programmed balancing support for the new Spyder 5 Controller using a mixin class and tags to access device points; developed set, override, and auto actions for controller points; and coded actions to backup and restore device data.</p>
       <p><b> Due to Honeywell's privacy and security reasons, I am unable to share the code I worked on.</b></p>

       <h3>Personal Projects: Recipe Ventures </h3>
       <p>Recipe Ventures is a recipe look-up Android app. It prompts a user to enter any snack/meal/food of interest and then adds it to a home screen list. A user can then click on the given input and a specific recipe with a title, photo, and instructions will appear. If the recipe is unsatisfactory, a user can click to find another recipe until they are happy. This project along with others like making my own Minesweeper game (check out my repo!) improved my Kotlin and Android skills.</p>

       <h3>Research: Expanding Blocks4All</h3>
       <h3>Clare Boothe Luce Scholar</h3>
       <p>For this application, I worked with a team to create an accessible version of Wonder Workshop's Blockly application. This app encourages youth to learn block-based programming, but it is not accessible for low vision and blind students. My Professor Lauren R. Milne began the process of creating Blocks4All as a graduate student. My role this summer was to expand the backend to enable students to save, load, create functions, and utilize variables to make the robot Dash do whatever they want. Moreover, I provided support for VoiceOver and Switch Control so low vision and blind students can more easily navigate the app. I performed this research as a Clare Boothe Luce Scholar, which was a scholarship awarded to eight students at Macalester College in 2019.</p>

       <h3>Nessie: Your Personal Calendar Assistant</h3>
       <p> I created my calendar application along with my Software Development classmates. We programmed a scheduling algorithm that randomly finds free time on students’ google calendars based on how often and for how long they want to work on assignments. I primarily acted as a frontend developer, using Bootstrap to create an interactive assignment planner that easily allows users to schedule assignments.</p>

       <p>I launched 'The Needham Historical Walk App' along with three other members of Needham High School’s Girls Who Code organization along with the support of TripAdvisor. This mobile application describes past historical sites of Needham in order to encourage Needham residents investment in their community. My tasks ranged from communicating with the staff at Needham’s History and Science Museum as well as adding functionality so that users can locate specific sites on Google Maps, and then receive directions based on their personal location.</p>
